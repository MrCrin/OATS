# OATS Changelog

##Developed by Michael Crinnion (crin@crin.co.uk)

OATS (α 0.0.3) // New features, some UI polish

	FEATURES
	
		Mark
			- Editing is now disabled for assessment cards previously completed
			by any user other than yourself to prevent accidental (or deliberate)
			changing of other teachers assessments. The data is still visible.
	
		View
			- Added 'delete' button to all previous assessment tabs belonging to
			current user. 'Deleted' rows are timestamped as such in the database
			but are not actually dropped from the table. Possibility for
			'recycle bin' feature or 'restore' feature in the future.
			- Added Expand All and Collaps All buttons
			
		UI
			- Changed modal 'lightshade' effect to also cover top navigation bar
			to prevent multiple attempts to load one class which can b0rk the
			Ajax requests (Thanks to Joe Wood for spotting this potential issue)
			- Minor visual tweaks to the loading and error popups.
			- Added fadeIn/fadeOut to form fields where existing data is being
			loaded from the database to avoid ugly 'pop in'.
			
	GENERAL	
		- Removed unnecessary repetition of expandTab() code
		- Redefined expandTab() as toggleTab() and added 'collapsed' class to tabs
		as a default
